revision of numpy notes

so what is numpy ?
this a library that basically run on c for faster calculations 
and is used in python for matematical calculations

numpy is basically n dimensional array of homogenous data types

so how it is different from list in python
np array contains homogenous data types
python list can manage their size dynamically whereas in np array if we 
change size array delete itself then recreates with new size in memory

way to declare np.array

np.array([]) -1d vector
np.array([[]])- 2d matrix
np.array([[[]]])-3d tensor

np.ones((row,column))
np.zeroes((row,column))

np.identity(shape)

np.arange(lower limit of number, upper limit,step).reshape step is optional

np.linspace(lower limit, upper limit,number) 
initialize mentioned number of numbers with same distance

np.random.random(row , column)
initialize tensor with random number between 0-1

=> some other things
np.arange(1,4).reshape(3,1)
since there are 3 elements so we can either reshape it into 3,1 or 1,3

ndim - tell about number of dimention of arrya

size - number of elements present
itemsize - size of element occupying in memory

shape - tell number of rows and column


to change of data type we can use dtype after declaration for ex
np.arange(2,4,dtype='float')
we cannot change dtype in arange to str 
in random.random  we cannot change dtype to float directly since it is 
designed to randomly initialize values between 0-1 
rather we can change dtype by
np.random.random(2,4).astype(float)
